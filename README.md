# MEE-342-Bearing-and-Key

For key selection, the inputs are the torque, the bore diameters, and the gear hub lengths. 
A factor of saftey of two is chosed for this application. 
Other material proporties are defined from a table in the textbook. 
First solve for force. 
Use the factor of saftey relationship to create a new equation that allows to solve to the length. 
Verify this length does not fail under crushing.
