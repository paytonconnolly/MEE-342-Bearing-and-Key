# MEE-342-Bearing-and-Key
For bearing selection, the inputs are radial load, axial load, desired reliability, desired amount of roations, and the desired life. 
Use the pythagorean theorem to find the equivalent force of axial and radial combined. 
Add Weibull parameters to the code that are used in later equations. 
Using the desired life and rating life calculate the desired dimentionless life measure.
Using equation 11-10 from the textbook to calculate the catalog load rateing C10. 
Once the C10 value is calculated it can be compared textbook value and then the bore outer diameter and width can be taken from the table values. 

For key selection, the inputs are the torque, the bore diameters, and the gear hub lengths. 
A factor of saftey of two is chosed for this application. 
Other material proporties are defined from a table in the textbook. 
First solve for force. 
Use the factor of saftey relationship to create a new equation that allows to solve to the length. 
Verify this length does not fail under crushing.
